Notebook
---------

1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- Heart beatsound Data
3. Create multiple datasets
		- Beats Sounds 
		- Heart Beats
           	- Multi heart Beats
4. Feature extraction
	- librosa to extract features
		- MFCC
		- Chroma STFT
		- MelSpectrogram Value
		- Zero Crossing Rate
		- RMS value
5. Data Visualization
		- Sample Outcome for each data
6. Label Encoding 
7. Selecting the X and y  Data
8. Splitting the dataset
9. Building the model  for each data

            - SVM
            - XGBoost
            - NLP
            - LightGBM
		- Voting Classifier (AdaBoosted + BaggingNLP)


10. Training and Building the model
11. Comparing the models with accuracy, precision,f1 score,  Recall
12. Comparison graphs are generated with scores of all models.

FrontEnd
---------

12. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite DB
13. For the frontend we have used dataset 
14. User gives input
15. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
16. Trained model is used for prediction
17. Final outcome is displayed through frontend
